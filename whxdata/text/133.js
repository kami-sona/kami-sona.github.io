However, it is assumed that the circuit element current is varying quasi-statically, that is, there is no instantaneous feedback between the current through the referenced device and the behavioral source output. Similarly, any ac component of such a device current is assumed to be zero in a small signal linear .AC analysis. These limitations stem from the modified nodal analysis (MNA) employed by LTspice, which leads to a set of equations that does not contain those device currents as solution. As a result, it is impossible to express a relationship between those device currents and the value of the behavioral source as equation. This does not apply to independent voltage sources, thus you can use these as current probes instead if required."," ","The keyword, \"time\" meaning the current time in the simulation."," ","The keyword, \"pi\" meaning 3.14159265358979323846."," ","The following functions:\n        "," ","Function Name"," ","Description"," ","abs(x)"," ","Absolute value of x"," ","absdelay(x,t[,tmax])"," ","x delayed by t.

This means that when you import a 3rd party model you may need to translate the syntax such as x^y to x**y or even pwr(x,y)."," ","If an optional Laplace transform is defined, that transform is applied to the result of the behavioral current or voltage. The Laplace transform must be a function solely of s. The frequency response at frequency f is found by substituting s with sqrt(-1)*2*pi*f. The time domain behavior is found from the sum of the instantaneous current(or voltage) with the convolution of the history of this current(or voltage) with the impulse response. Numerical inversion of a Laplace transfer function to the time domain impulse response is a potentially compute-bound process and a topic of current numerical research. In LTspice, the impulse response is found from the FFT of a discrete set points in frequency domain response. This process is prone to the usual artifacts of FFT's such as spectral leakage and picket fencing that is common to discrete FFT's. LTspice uses a proprietary algorithm that exploits that it has an exact analytical expression for the frequency domain response and chooses points and windows to cause such artifacts to diffract precisely to zero. However, LTspice must guess an appropriate frequency range and resolution. It is recommended that the LTspice first be allowed to make a guess at this. The length of the window and number of FFT data points used will be reported in the .log file. You can then adjust the algorithm's choices by explicitly setting nfft and window length. The reciprocal of the value of the window is the frequency resolution. The value of nfft times this resolution is the highest frequency considered. Note that the convolution of the impulse response with the behavioral source is also potentially a compute bound process."," ","Copyright © 1998–2025 by Analog Devices Inc.
