R+ and R- are the nodes for the other port. Zo is the characteristic impedance. The length of the line is given by the propagation delay Td."," ","This element models only one propagation mode. If all four nodes are distinct in the actual circuit, then two modes may be excited. To simulate such a situation, two transmission-line elements are required.
