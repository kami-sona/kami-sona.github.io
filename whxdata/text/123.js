This allows one user to prepare a library that another user can use in a simulation without revealing the implementation of the library. A reasonable attempt has been made to make the encrypted library difficult to decode by unauthorized concerns, but it cannot be considered perfectly secure if for no other reason than it is implemented in software."," ","To prepare an encrypted library, you need to invoke LTspice from the command line with the command line option \"-encrypt\". You will need to first backup the library because it will be replaced with the encrypted version. THERE EXISTS NO UTILITY TO CONVERT AN ENCRYPTED LIBRARY BACK TO CLEAR TEXT. Below summarizes the two steps:"," ","Make a backup copy of the library. The version you encrypt is deleted."," ","From a command line, type"," ","\\ltspice.exe -encrypt < filename>"," ","The file <filename> will be replaced with an encrypted version. The encryption process will take a few minutes."," ","One this process is finished, you have an encrypted ASCII file.
