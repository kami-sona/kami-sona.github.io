The model card keywords NPN and PNP indicate the polarity of the transistor."," ","The bipolar junction transistor model is an adaptation of the integral charge control model of Gummel and Poon. This modified Gummel-Poon model extends the original model to include several effects at high bias levels, quasi-saturation, and substrate conductivity. The model automatically simplifies to the Ebers-Moll model when certain parameters are not specified. The DC model is defined by the parameters Is, Bf, Nf, Ise, Ikf, and Ne which determine the forward current gain characteristics, Is, Br, Nr, Isc, Ikr, and Nc which determine the reverse current gain characteristics, and Vaf and Var which determine the output conductance for forward and reverse regions. Three ohmic resistances Rb, Rc and Re, are included, where Rb can be high current dependent. Base charge storage is modeled by forward and reverse transit times, Tf and Tr, the forward transit time Tf being bias dependent if desired; and nonlinear depletion layer capacitances, which are determined by Cje, Vje and Mje, for the B-E junction, Cjc, Vjc, and MJC for the B-C junction and Cjs, Vjs, and Mjs for the collector-substrate junction. The temperature dependence of the saturation current, Is, is determined by the energy gap, Eg, and the saturation-current temperature exponent, XTI. Additionally base current temperature dependence is modeled by the beta temperature exponent XTB in the new model. The values specified are assumed to have been measured at the temperature TNOM, which can be specified on the .OPTIONS control line or overridden by a specification on the .model line."," ","The BJT
