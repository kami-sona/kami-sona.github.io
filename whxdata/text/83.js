If Ih is zero, the switch is always completely on or off according to whether the control current is above threshold. If Ih is positive, the switch shows hysteresis with trip point currents at It - Ih and It + Ih. If Ih is negative, the switch will smoothly transition between the on and off impedances. The transition occurs between the control currents of It - Ih and It + Ih. The smooth transition follows a low order polynomial fit to the logarithm of the switch's conduction."," ","Copyright © 1998–2025 by Analog Devices Inc. All Rights Reserved."]],"id":"83"})
