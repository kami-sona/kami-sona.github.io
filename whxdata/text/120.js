For SMPS, these losses are of usually of no consequence, but may be turned off if desired. On the \"Tools > Settings > Hacks!\" page, uncheck \"Supply a min. inductor damping if no Rpar is given.\" This setting will be remembered between invocations of the program. There is also a default series resistance of 1mΩ for inductors that aren't mentioned in a mutual inductance statement. This Rser allows LTspice to integrate the inductance as a Norton equivalent circuit instead of Thevenin equivalent in order to reduce the size of the circuit's linearized matrix. If you don't want LTspice to introduce this minimum resistance, you must explicitly set Rser=0 for that inductor."," ","There are two forms of non-linear inductors available in LTspice. One is a behavioral inductance specified with an expression for the flux. The inductor's current is referred to by the keyword \"x\" in the expression.

You can read out the inductance as V(n001) since current source I1 supplies a unity dI/dt. The core follows the initial magnetization curve, so you can see that the permeability first increases from the initial value as the current is ramped and then drops as it saturates. Since the gap makes the inductance insensitive to the exact permeability of the core, you have to really zoom in on V(n001) to see that it does increase. The peak is when H inside the core is equal to its Hc."," ","*","\n      L1 N001 0 Hc=16.
