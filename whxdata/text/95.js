Don't change the symbol, just the instances of the symbol as a component on a schematic. You can access this attribute by holding down the control key and right clicking on the body of the component."," ","Edit the \"Value\" attribute of the component to coincide with the name of the subcircuit you wish to use."," ","Add a SPICE directive on the schematic such as \".inc filename\" where filename is the name of the file containing the definition of the subcircuit. Note that this must be the complete name with any file extension and Windows Explorer defaults to not showing the file extension. So you if you have a file called \"mylib.sub.txt\", which you can edit/view in notepad, and Windows Explorer shows you the file exists as \"mylib.sub\" The SPICE directive to include this file is \".inc mylib.sub.txt\" If you used, \".inc mylib.sub\" you will get an error message that that file can't be found."," ","Copyright © 1998–2025 by Analog Devices Inc.
