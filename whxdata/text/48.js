Note that you would have to make a set of symbols that have the same pin order as the LTspice symbol. Some PCB tools don't even define their diode to netlist against standard SPICE pin order. Also, LTspice symbol pin numbers are often different than the Analog Devices product pin numbers, especially when a product is available in more than one package."," ","The following formats are available: Accel, Algorex, Allegro, Applicon Bravo, Applicon Leap, Cadnetix, Calay, Calay90, CBDS, Computervision, EE Designer, ExpressPCB, Intergraph, Mentor, Multiwire, PADS, Scicards, Tango, Telesis, Vectron, and Wire List."," ","Copyright © 1998–2025 by Analog Devices Inc.
