You can specify the name of a node so the netlister doesn't make one up for you.

That is, it's not the SPICE global common and it's not a global node. This is useful for circuits with multiple ground domains and/or isolated domains, by providing a graphical symbol associated with a node distinct from global ground."," ","If you give a node a name starting with the characters \"$G_\"; as in for example, \"$G_VDD\"; then that node is global no matter where the name occurs in the circuit hierarchy."," ","It is possible to indicate that a node is a port of type input, output, or bi-directional. These port types will be drawn differently but have no significance to the netlister. Indicating a port type can make circuit more readable. Global nodes are also drawn differently in that a box is drawn around the name."," ","Copyright © 1998–2025 by Analog Devices Inc. All Rights Reserved."]],"id":"73"})
