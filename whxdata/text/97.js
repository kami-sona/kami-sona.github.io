First, the DC operating point of the circuit is found. Next, linearized small signal models for all of the nonlinear devices in the circuit are found for this operating point. Finally, using independent voltage and current sources as the driving signal, the resultant linearized circuit is solved in the frequency domain over the specified range of frequencies."," ","This mode of analysis is useful for filters, networks, stability analysis, and noise considerations.
