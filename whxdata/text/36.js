The switching regulator models that ship with LTspice use intrinsic SPICE devices designed to encapsulate the behavior of ADI's switching regulator products. Even if you succeed in making a model with standard SPICE primitives, the simulation will run orders of magnitude slower. Note that some people have made such switching regulator models with standard SPICE devices. LTspice can run these models and will usually outperform the simulator for which they were targeted."," ","Copyright © 1998–2025 by Analog Devices Inc.
