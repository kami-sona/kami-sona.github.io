If the machine is in <old state> and the expression of < condition> evaluates to something larger that .5, the machine advances to <new state>. Only one rule executes per timestep. The character '*' as the value of <old state> matches any state. Such rules are checked first."," ","The .output statements implement current sources that require external devices to readout the current. As shown in the examples below, 1K ground-referenced resistors are normally used, but you might want to add some parallel capacitance to ground to slow transitions. The <expression> can be an arbitrary mathematical expression. This expression recognizes the special name \"state\", which represents the value of the current state. It also recognizes the names of all defined states, which represent their corresponding numerical values."," ","The simplest example of an Arbitrary State Machine would be one with no states. This is an example of an inverter:"," ","* inverter state machine example","\n      V1 1 0 pulse(0 1 0 1u 1u .5m 1m)","\n      R1 2 0 1K ; an impedance for the .output statement","\n      .machine","\n      .output (2) V(1) < .5","\n      .endmachine","\n      .tran 3m","\n      .end"," ","Here is an example of a divide by 2 with a reset:"," ","* divide by 2 example","\n      V1 1 0 pulse(0 1 0 1u 1u .5m 1m)","\n      V2 c 0 pulse(0 1 0 1u 1u 5m 10m)","\n      R1 2 0 1K","\n      R2 3 0 1K","\n      R3 4 0 1K","\n      R4 5 0 1K","\n      .machine","\n      .state S0a 0","\n      .state S0b 0","\n      .state S1a 1","\n      .state S1b 1","\n      .rule S0a S0b V(1) < .5","\n      .rule S0b S1a V(1) > .5","\n      .rule S1a S1b V(1) < .5","\n      .rule S1b S0a V(1) > .5","\n      .rule * S0a V(c) > .5","\n      .output (2) V(1) < .5","\n      .output (3) V(1) > .5","\n      .output (4) state","\n      .output (5) state==S1a","\n      .endmachine","\n      .tran 30m","\n      .end"," ","Copyright © 1998–2025 by Analog Devices Inc.
