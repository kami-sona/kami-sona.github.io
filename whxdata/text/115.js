These symbols cover most of ADI's power ICs, opamps, comparators, and many general-purpose devices for circuit design. You can also draw your own symbols for devices and subcircuits."," ","LTspice schematic editing is a \"verb-noun\" interface instead of \"noun-verb.\" This means that instead of first selecting objects (the nouns) to move, stretch, copy, or delete (the verbs); you first select the action and then the object. Hence, when you wish to move, mirror, rotate, stretch or delete objects, first select the move, stretch or delete command. Then you can select an object by clicking on it. You can select multiple objects by dragging a box about them. The program will stay in the move, stretch, or delete mode until the right mouse button is clicked or the Esc key is pressed. The verb-noun approach reduces the amount of mouse syntax required to edit schematics. Once mastered, it allows the user to draft faster in LTspice than is possible with pencil and paper."],[" ","Undo the last command."],[" ","Redo the last Undo command."],[" ","Place text on the schematic.
