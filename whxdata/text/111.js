Note that a comprehensive search for symbols is made when you open a new or existing Schematic or you press Refresh in the Place Component dialog—this search is used to populate the Place Component dialog. Note that search checks for symbol files in all subfolders of your schematic‘s folder. If your schematic is placed in a folder containing a deep hierarchy, or is on a slow network drive, you may get a message asking if you do not want to complete the search, i.e. taking a long time.
