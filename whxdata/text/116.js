This function works with a current source used as a load with a list of step currents. The procedure is:"," ","compute to steady state and discard the history unless ","nodiscard"," is set."," ","ramp the step load to the next value in the list of currents at the rate of 20A/μs."," ","compute to steady state"," ","change the step load to the next value in the list or quit if there is none."," ","Due to the circuit complexity, the automatic STEP transition might not be detectable. Under this circumstance, it is best to use the .TRAN command to run the transient simulation and observe the starting and ending periods of the desired step load response. Use PWL command to program the output load current and switches to different levels at desired time periods. For example:"," ","PWL(0 0.5 1m 0.5 1.01m 0.1 3m 0.1 3.01m 0.5)"," ","The load current starts with 0.5A at time 0, stays at 0.5A at 1ms, switches to 0.1A at time 1.01ms, stays at 0.1A until 3ms, and switches to 0.5A at 3.01ms and stays at 0.5A."," ","The PWL can have almost unlimited pairs of (time, value) sequence."," ","Copyright © 1998–2025 by Analog Devices Inc.
