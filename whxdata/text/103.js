Voltage Dependent Current Source"]],"3":[[" ","Symbol Names: G, G2"," ","There are three types of voltage dependent current-source circuit elements."," ","Syntax:"," ","Gxxx n+ n- nc+ nc- <gain>"," ","This circuit element asserts an output current between the nodes n+ and n- that depends on the input voltage between nodes nc+ and nc-. This is a linearly dependent source specified solely by a constant gain."," ","Syntax:"," ","Gxxx n+ n- nc+ nc- table=(<value pair>, <value pair>, ...)"," ","Here a lookup table is used to specify the transfer function. The table is a list of pairs of numbers. The second value of the pair is the output current when the control voltage is equal to the first value of that pair. The output is linearly interpolated when the control voltage is between specified points. If the control voltage is beyond the range of the look-up table, the output current is extrapolated as a constant current of the last point of the look-up table."," ","Syntax:"," ","Gxxx n+ n- nc+ nc- Laplace=<func(s)> [window=<time>] [nfft=<number>] [mtol=<number>]"," ","The transfer function of this circuit element is specified by its Laplace transform. The Laplace transform must be a function of s. The frequency response at frequency f is found by substituting s with sqrt(-1)*2*pi*f. The time-domain behavior is found from the impulse response, which is found from the Fourier transform of the frequency-domain response. LTspice must guess an appropriate frequency range and resolution. The response must drop at high frequencies or an error is reported. It is recommended that the LTspice first be allowed to make a guess at this and then check the accuracy by reducing reltol or explicitly setting nfft and window. The reciprocal of the value of window is the frequency resolution. The value of nfft times this resolution is the highest frequency considered. The operator \"^\" is understood to mean exponentiation \"**\" when used in a Laplace expression."," ","Syntax:"," ","Gxxx n+ n- value={<expression>}"," ","This is an alternative syntax of the arbitrary behavioral voltage source B."," ","Syntax:"," ","Gxxx n+ n- POLY(<N>) <(node1+,node1-) (node2+,node2-) ...

It is useful for running legacy behavioral models."," ","Copyright © 1998–2025 by Analog Devices Inc. All Rights Reserved."]],"id":"103"})
