This directive suppresses this initialization. The initial conditions of some circuit elements can be specified on an instance-per-instance basis. Uic is not a particularly recommended feature of SPICE. Skipping the DC operating point analysis leads to a nonphysical initial condition. For example, consider a voltage source connected in parallel to a capacitance. The node voltage is taken as zero if not specified. Then, in the first time step, an infinite current is required to charge the capacitor. The simulator cannot find a short enough time step to make the current nonsingular, and a \"time step too small convergence fail\" message is issued."," ","Use of this modifier is highly discouraged. In particular, it is not a viable workaround for DC operating point convergence problems."," ","Copyright © 1998–2025 by Analog Devices Inc. All Rights Reserved."]],"id":"53"})
