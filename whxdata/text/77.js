Useful for generating netlists for SPICE simulators that don't understand the 'μ' character as the metric multiplier of 1e-6."," ","Reverse comp. order: Circuit elements are normally netlisted in the order in which they were added to the schematic. Checking this box causes this order to be reversed."," ","Default Devices: A default model statement is included in the netlist.  For example, if a diode is used in an LTspice schematic, the default model statement \".model D D\" is added to the netlist to suppress messages about using the default model. Unchecking this option suppresses inclusion of this line as well as the analogous model statements for bipolar, MOSFET, and JFET transistors."," ","Default Libraries: Automatically include standard and user component libraries in the netlist for all component types used in the schematic.  For example, if a diode is used in an LTspice schematic, the default library, %LOCALAPPDATA%\\LTspice\\lib\\cmp\\standard.dio, is included in the simulation netlist by a .lib statement. If a user library file user.dio exists (default directory is Documents/LTspice, configurable in the Search Paths tab) this will also be included by a .lib statement in the netlist.  Unchecking this option suppresses inclusion of these libraries as well as the analogous library statements for bipolar, MOSFET, and JFET transistors."," ","Copyright © 1998–2025 by Analog Devices Inc.
