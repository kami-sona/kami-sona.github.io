Note that the model card keywords NJF and PJF specify the polarity of the transistor. The area factor determines the number of equivalent parallel devices of a specified model."," ","The JFET model is derived from the FET model of Shichman and Hodges extended to include Gate junction recombination current and impact ionization. The DC characteristics are defined by the parameters VTO and BETA, which determine the variation of drain current with gate voltage; LAMBDA, which determines the output conductance; and Is, the saturation current of the two gate junctions. Two ohmic resistances, Rd and Rs, are included. Charge storage is modeled by nonlinear depletion layer capacitances for both gate junctions; which vary as the -1/2 power of junction voltage and are defined by the parameters Cgs, Cgd, and PB. A fitting parameter B has been added. See A. E. Parker and D. J.
