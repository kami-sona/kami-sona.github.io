These parameters are computed if the process parameters(NSUB, TOX,...) are given, but user-specified values always override. VTO is positive (negative) for enhancement mode and negative (positive) for depletion mode N-channel (P-channel) devices. Charge storage is modeled by three constant capacitors, CGSO, CGDO, and CGBO which represent overlap capacitances, by the nonlinear thin-oxide capacitance which is distributed among the gate, source, drain, and bulk regions, and by the nonlinear depletion-layer capacitances for both substrate junctions divided into bottom and periphery, which vary as the MJ and MJSW power of junction voltage respectively, and are determined by the parameters CBD, CBS, CJ, CJSW, MJ, MJSW and PB. Channel capacitance is implemented as a Yang-Chatterjee charge-based model in all aspects of simulation but legacy Meyer capacitances are reported in the log file. The thin-oxide charge-storage effects are treated slightly different for the Level=1 model. These voltage dependent capacitances are included only if Tox is specified."," ","There is some overlap among the parameters describing the junctions, e.g., the reverse current can be specified either through Is[Amp] or through Js[Amp/m/m]. Whereas the first is an absolute value the second is multiplied by Ad and As to give the reverse current of the drain and source junctions respectively. The same idea applies also to the zero-bias junction capacitances CBD and CBS[Farad] on the one hand, and CJ[Farad/m/m] on the other. The parasitic drain and source series resistance can be expressed as either RD and RS[Ohms] or RSH[Ohms/square], the latter being multiplied by the number of squares NRD and NRS input on the device

transistor(VDMOS) popularly used in board level switch mode power supplies has behavior that is qualitatively different than the above monolithic MOSFET models. In particular, (i) the body diode of a VDMOS transistor is connected differently to the external terminals than the substrate diode of a monolithic MOSFET and (ii) the gate-drain capacitance(Cgd) non-linearity cannot be modeled with the simple graded capacitances of monolithic MOSFET models. In a VDMOS transistor, Cgd abruptly changes about zero gate-drain voltage(Vgd). When Vgd is negative, Cgd is physically based on a capacitor with the gate as one electrode and the drain on the back of the die as the other electrode. This capacitance is fairly low due to the thickness of the non-conducting die. But when Vgd is positive, the die is conducting and Cgd is physically based on a capacitor with the thickness of the gate oxide."," ","Traditionally, elaborate subcircuits have been used to duplicate the behavior of a power MOSFET. A new intrinsic spice device was written that encapsulates this behavior in the interest of compute speed, reliability of convergence, and simplicity of writing models. The DC model is the same as a level 1 monolithic MOSFET except that the length and width default to one so that transconductance can be directly specified without scaling. The AC model treats the gate-source capacitance as constant. This was empirically found to be a good approximation for power MOSFETS if the gate-source voltage is not driven negative. The gate-drain capacitance follows the following empirically found form:"," ","For positive Vgd, Cgd varies as the hyperbolic tangent of Vgd. For negative Vdg, Cgd varies as the arc tangent of Vgd. The model parameters a, Cgdmin, and Cgdmax parameterize the gate drain capacitance. The source-drain capacitance is supplied by the graded capacitance of a body diode connected across the source drain electrodes, outside of the source and drain resistances."," ","Name"," ","Description"," ","Units"," ","Default"," ","Example"," ","Vto"," ","Threshold voltage"," ","V"," ","0"," ","1.0"," ","Kp"," ","Transconductance parameter"," ","A/V","2"," ","1."," ",".5"," ","Phi"," ","Surface inversion potential"," ","V"," ","0.6"," ","0.65"," ","Lambda"," ","Channel-length modulation"," ","1/V"," ","0."," ","0.02"," ","mtriode"," ","Conductance multiplier in triode region(allows independent fit of triode and saturation regions"," ","-"," ","1."," ","2."," ","Ksubthres"," ","subthreshold conduction parameter"," ","-"," ","0."," ","1m"," ","BV"," ","Vds breakdown voltage"," ","V"," ","Infin."," ","40"," ","IBV"," ","Current at Vds=BV"," ","A"," ","100pA"," ","1u"," ","NBV"," ","Vds breakdown emission coefficient"," ","-"," ","1."," ","10"," ","Rd"," ","Drain ohmic resistance"," ","Ω"," ","0."," ","1."," ","Rs"," ","Source ohmic resistance"," ","Ω"," ","0."," ","1."," ","Rg"," ","Gate ohmic resistance"," ","Ω"," ","0."," ","2."," ","Rds"," ","Drain-source shunt resistance"," ","Ω"," ","Infin."," ","10Meg"," ","Rb"," ","Body diode ohmic resistance"," ","Ω"," ","0."," ",".5"," ","Cjo"," ","Zero-bias body diode junction capacitance"," ","F"," ","0."," ","1n"," ","Cgs"," ","Gate-source capacitance"," ","F"," ","0."," ","500p"," ","Cgdmin"," ","Minimum non-linear G-D capacitance"," ","F"," ","0."," ","300p"," ","Cgdmax"," ","Maximum non-linear G-D capacitance"," ","F"," ","0."," ","1000p"," ","A"," ","Non-linear Cgd capacitance parameter"," ","-"," ","1."," ",".5"," ","Is"," ","Body diode saturation current"," ","A"," ","1e-14"," ","1e-15"," ","N"," ","Bulk diode emission coefficient"," ","-"," ","1."," ","Vj"," ","Body diode junction potential"," ","V"," ","1."," ","0.87"," ","M"," ","Body diode grading coefficient"," ","-"," ","0.5"," ","0.5"," ","Fc"," ","Body diode coefficient for forward-bias depletion capacitance formula"," ","-"," ","0.5"," ","oneway"," ","Behavioral modeling flag to indicate current can only flow in one direction in the channel"," ","-"," ","-"," ","-"," ","tt"," ","Body diode transit time"," ","sec"," ","0."," ","10n"," ","Eg"," ","Body diode activation energy for temperature effect on Is"," ","eV"," ","1.11"," ","Xti"," ","Body diode saturation current temperature exponent"," ","-"," ","3."," ","L"," ","Length scaling"," ","-"," ","1."," ","W"," ","Width scaling"," ","-"," ","1."," ","Kf"," ","Flicker noise coefficient"," ","-"," ","0."," ","Af"," ","Flicker noise exponent"," ","-"," ","1."," ","nchan"," ","N-channel VDMOS"," ","-"," ","(true)"," ","-"," ","pchan"," ","P-channel VDMOS"," ","-"," ","(false)"," ","-"," ","Tnom"," ","Parameter measurement temperature"," ","°C"," ","27"," ","50"," ","Lmin"," ","Bin length lower limit"," ","m"," ","0."," ","10u"," ","Lmax"," ","Bin length upper limit"," ","m"," ","0."," ","20u"," ","Wmin"," ","Bin width lower limit"," ","m"," ","0."," ","1"," ","Wmax"," ","Bin width upper limit"," ","m"," ","0."," ","10"," ","Bex"," ","Power of Kp temp dependence"," ","n.a."," ","-1.5"," ","-1.6"," ","vtotc"," ","Vto tempco.
