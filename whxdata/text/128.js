If the source is flagged as a load, the source is forced to be dissipative, that is, the current goes to zero if the voltage between nodes n+ and n- goes to zero. If a negative current is specified, the load keyword is ignored.  The purpose of this option is to model a current load on a power supply that doesn't draw current if the output voltage is zero. When flagged as a load, the current source starts to deviate from a constant current when the voltage across it drops to 0.5V. The impedance eventually drops to a resistance equal to .25Ω/A times the value of the current source."," ","For AC analysis, the value of AC is used as the amplitude of the source at the analysis frequency."],[" ","Syntax:"," ","Ixxx n+ n- PULSE(Ioff Ion Tdelay Trise Tfall Ton Tperiod Ncycles)"," ","Name"," ","Description"," ","Units"," ","Ioff"," ","Initial value"," ","A"," ","Ion"," ","Pulsed value"," ","A"," ","Tdelay"," ","Delay"," ","sec"," ","Tr"," ","Rise time"," ","sec"," ","Tf"," ","Fall time"," ","sec"," ","Ton"," ","On time"," ","sec"," ","Tperiod"," ","Period"," ","sec"," ","Ncycles"," ","Number of cycles(Omit for free-running pulse function)"," ","cycles"],[" ","Syntax:"," ","Ixxx n+ n- SINE(Ioffset Iamp Freq Td Theta Phi Ncycles)"," ","Name"," ","Description"," ","Units"," ","Ioffset"," ","DC offset"," ","A"," ","Iamp"," ","Amplitude"," ","A"," ","Freq"," ","Frequency"," ","Hz"," ","Td"," ","Delay"," ","sec"," ","Theta"," ","Damping factor"," ","1/sec"," ","Phi"," ","Phase of sine wave"," ","degrees"," ","Ncycles"," ","Number of cycles(Omit for free-running pulse function)"," ","cycles"," ","For times less than Td, the output current is given by"," ","Ioffset+Iamp*sin(π*Phi/180)"," ","For times after Td, but before Ncycles have completed, the current is given by"," ","Ioffset+Iamp*exp(-(time-Td)*Theta)*sin(2*π*Freq*(time-Td)+π*Phi/180)"," ","For times after Ncycles have completed, the current is the last current when Ncycles completed.
