A few of these and their behavior are undocumented."," ","INV, BUF, AND, OR, and XOR are generic idealized behavioral gates. All gates are netlisted with eight terminals. These gates require no external power. Current is sourced or sunk from the complementary outputs, terminals 6 and 7, and returned through device common, terminal 8. Terminals 1 through 5 are inputs. Unused inputs and outputs are to be connected to terminal 8. LTspice recognizes that as a flag that that terminal is not used and removes it from the simulation. This leads to the potentially confusing situation where AND gates act differently when an input is grounded or at zero volts. If ground is the gate's common, then the grounded input is not at a logic false condition, but simply not part of the simulation. The reason that these gates are implemented like that is that this allows one device to act as 2-, 3-, 4- or 5- input gates with true, inverted, or complementary output with no simulation speed penalty for unused terminals. That is, the AND device acts as 12 different types of AND gates. The gates default to 0V/1V logic with a logic threshold of .5V, no propagation delay, and a 1Ohm output impedance.

Input hold time is equal to the propagation delay."," ","The input logic threshold defaults to (Vhigh+Vlow)/2 but can be set with the instance parameter Ref. The hold time is equal to the propagation delay."," ","The exclusive XOR device has non-standard behavior when more than two inputs are used: The output is true only when exactly one of all inputs is true. Use the associative property of XOR's with multiple XOR devices to implement an XOR block with more than two inputs."," ","The Schmitt trigger devices have similar output characteristics as the gates. Their trip points are specified with instance parameters Vt and Vh. The low trip point is Vt-Vh and the high trip point is Vt+Vh."," ","The gates and Schmitt trigger devices do supply time step information if rise and/or fall time are specified. It is recommended not to specify the tripdt parameter in this case. Otherwise, tripdt can be set to stipulate a maximum time step size the simulator takes across state changes."," ","The VARISTOR is a voltage controlled varistor. Its breakdown voltage is set by the voltage between terminals 1 and 2. Its breakdown impedance is specified with the instance parameter rclamp. See the example schematic .\\examples\\Educational\\varistor.asc"," ","The MODULATE device is a voltage controlled oscillator. See the example schematic .\\examples\\Educational\\PLL.asc. The instantaneous oscillation frequency is set by the voltage on the FM input. The conversion from voltage to frequency is linear and set by the two instance parameters, mark and space. Mark is the frequency when the FM input is at 1V and space is the frequency when the input is at 0V. The amplitude is set by the voltage on the AM input and defaults to 1V if that input is unused(connected to the MODULATE common)."," ","The schematic capture aspect of LTspice netlists symbols for these devices in a special manner.
